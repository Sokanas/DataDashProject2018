# Additional ScanJS Rules for ESLint.

These are supplemental rules for ESLint to introduce functionality similar to
to what the existing ScanJS rules do.

This package does *not* contain rules that are already within ESLint but 
required for full ScanJS feature parity. You are therefore encouraged to use 
these rules with a provided config, which is available
as *eslint-config-scanjs*
