1. Basic Line Graph
    BASIC LINE GRAPH IS CURRENTLY COMPLETE




2. Dynamic Y Axis Scaling
    -> I think this is somewhat simple to implement but I won't know until I look into it.

3. Colouration of Line changing baseed on threshold values
    -> A single threshold may be doable

4. Dynamic granulation of data points in data series
    -> This is an automatic feature builtin to Power BI. Customising this will be hard


Note: Options added for item 2 and 3 in widget settings and PBI settings
Note: Data Granulation maybe difficult, however getting this done in a manner that TMD wants may be hard.
